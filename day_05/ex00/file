// what() is a virtual function of the std::exception class in C++.
// It returns a C-style character string that describes the exception.
// The purpose of the what() function is to provide a descriptive
// message that can be used to identify the type of the exception and the reason
// for the exception.

// In the code example you provided, the what() function is overridden
// by the GradeTooHighException and GradeTooLowException classes.
// These two classes are used to handle exceptions that may occur when the grade
// of a bureaucrat is out of a valid range. By providing a descriptive message
// using the what() function, these classes make it easier for the programmer 
// to identify the type of the exception and take appropriate action to handle it.

// For example, if an instance of the GradeTooHighException class is thrown,
// the programmer can catch the exception and call the what()
// function to retrieve the error message. The error message could be something
// like "Bureaucrat grade is too high!", which provides a clear
// indication of what went wrong and why.
